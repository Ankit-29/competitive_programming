'''
Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.
Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a 
letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.
Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true
Input: pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: false
