# Coin Change Problem (No of ways to make change)
'''
Given a value N, if we want to make change for amount N, and we 
have infinite supply of {c1,c2,c3} coins, In how many ways we 
can make the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.

def coinChange(coins: list, amount: int) -> int:

    dp = [[0]*(amount+1) for x in range(row)]
    dp[0][0] = 1
